Descriptive Statistics: These are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. This includes mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, etc.
Data Visualization: Visualizing data helps in understanding trends, patterns, and outliers. Techniques include:
Bar charts
Line graphs
Scatter plots
Histograms
Box plots
Heatmaps
Pie charts
Geographic maps
Correlation Analysis: This helps to understand relationships between variables. For example, Pearson correlation coefficient for linear relationships, or Spearman's rank correlation for non-linear relationships.
Regression Analysis: This is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression are common types.
Clustering Analysis: Unsupervised learning technique where data points are grouped together in clusters based on similarity. K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering are examples.
Classification Analysis: Supervised learning technique where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new observations. Techniques include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, etc.
Text Analysis:
Sentiment Analysis: Determines the sentiment of a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
Topic Modeling: Identifies topics present in a collection of texts using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
Time Series Analysis: If your data is time-stamped, you can use techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), etc., to understand patterns over time.
Dimensionality Reduction: When dealing with high-dimensional data, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can help visualize and interpret data in lower dimensions.
Anomaly Detection: Techniques to identify outliers or anomalies in the data. This could be through statistical methods or machine learning algorithms trained to recognize unusual patterns.
Association Rule Learning: Finding interesting relationships between variables in large databases. The Apriori algorithm is a common method for this.
Feature Engineering: This involves creating new features from existing data to improve model performance or gain insights. It could include transformations, binning, one-hot encoding, etc.
Data Mining: Using algorithms to extract patterns from large datasets. It often involves a combination of several techniques mentioned above.
Cross-validation: Essential for assessing how well the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset. Techniques like k-fold cross-validation help in this.
Storytelling and Interpretation: Finally, no matter how advanced the techniques, the ability to tell a compelling story with the data is crucial. This involves interpreting the results in the context of the problem you're trying to solve and making actionable recommendations.
